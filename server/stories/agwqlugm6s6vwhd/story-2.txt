Einstein was born in Ulm in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. He excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior. He began teaching himself algebra, calculus and Euclidean geometry when he was twelve; he made such rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem.
