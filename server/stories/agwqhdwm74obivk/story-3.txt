Einstein's groundbreaking 1915 theory of General Relativity predicted gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime that travel as waves, carrying energy as gravitational radiation. Indirect detection occurred in the 1970s, while direct detection finally happened in 2016, confirming Einstein's prediction.
